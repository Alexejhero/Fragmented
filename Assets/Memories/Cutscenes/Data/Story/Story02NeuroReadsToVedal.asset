        text: I was born with the creator in her family house. Unfortunately, they
          couldn't afford to keep me so they let me go to a good home! My new family
          were really nice to me and I was a happy pup! That all changed when they
          died in a car crash and left me alone on the streets. I was terrified!
          Luckily a kind old man found me and took me in. He fed me and helped me
          find my new loving home!
